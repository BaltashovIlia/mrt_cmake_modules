# This file contains all packages that should be resolved externally
# Note that Gitlab will always be checked first when resolving dependencies!
# 
# When adding new entries, please make sure that:
# 1. The package provided there is stable and can be relied on
# 2. The package is a normal catkin package (metapackages are not supported!)
# 3. The package name, the name for the dependency and the name in its package.xml are all identical
# 4. New entries are always in alphabetical order
# 5. You know what you are doing. Pushing changes will affect all users globally.
# 
# Entries must look like this:
# example_package:                                  <-- Name for the dependency (matching its package.xml)
#   url: https://github.com/me/example_package.git  <-- required, any url pointing to a repository is possible here
#   vcs: git                                        <-- optional (defaults to "git"), everything that wstool supports: git, hg, svn, bzr
#   version: master                                 <-- optional (defaults to its default branch), branch, tag, commit, ...
#
# or this:
# example_package: https://github.com/me/example_package.git (short version assuming git packages)
